# Pseudocode for ML Model Training

# Step 1: Data Preparation
# Input: Aggregated features from get_sensor_statistics_generic
# - Frequency, min, max, avg, std_dev for each relevant field (e.g., x, y, z of acceleration)
# Output: Labeled data suitable for ML training

Extract features from each time window (e.g., 5 seconds) for each sensor type
For each window, generate statistical features:
    - Frequency, min, max, average, std deviation

# Step 2: Model Selection and Training
# Use a model suitable for time series data, e.g., LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

Initialize ML model (e.g., LSTM or CNN)
Train model on extracted features with activity labels as the target
    - Input: Features (frequency, min, max, avg, std_dev)
    - Output: Predicted activity label

# Step 3: Model Evaluation
Split data into train/test sets
Evaluate model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall
Fine-tune model parameters if necessary

# Step 4: Prediction for New Data
For new sensor data, extract features in real-time or in a given range
Pass features to trained model to get predicted activity label

# Step 5: Integration with Frontend
Set up API to accept user input (sensor data, timestamp range)
Process input to extract features and pass to ML model for prediction
Return predicted activity label to the user on the frontend
